# NIT Rourkela-Advanced Programming Lab
All codes related to Advanced Programming Lab class in NIT Rourkela will be uploaded. I apologize in advance for any delay in uploading anything or wrong information. Let me know if there is anything worth correcting and I will do it as soon as possible.

Enjoy!

## Directory Structure
The main directory contains several folders based on each day of the lab. Problem statments included in each folder: 

- Day-*n*
    - Problem Statments.txt
    - _ProgramName_.java
    - _ProgramName_.class (you can easily rewrite this by compiling the Java files)

## Dependencies
This project will contain Java codes for now. Will update here if this changes later on. For running codes in this project, JDK, JRE will be needed. So based on your operating system install a suitable compiler. Tons of tutorials online.
